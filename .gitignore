# Ignore .env file
.env

# This tells Git to ignore the .env file and prevents it from being committed to your repository.

# Check the Status in Git:

# If you had already committed the .env file to Git earlier, you'll need to untrack it by using the following commands in your terminal:
# bash
# Copy
# Edit
# git rm --cached .env
# git commit -m "Remove .env from version control"
# After this, the .env file will be ignored and wonâ€™t be included in future commits.
